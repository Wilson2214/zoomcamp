# Data Engineering ZoomCamp Week 1

In an effort to learn some industry standard tools and continue to upskill in my Data Engineering journey, I have decided to enroll in a free data engineering bootcamp called the [DE Zoomcamp](https://dezoomcamp.streamlit.app/). It's an exciting opportunity to advance my skills in cloud computing, containerization, SQL, python, ETL, and other data engineering skills. In particular, I am excited to learn about industry tools for workflow orchestration and to dive deeper into stream processing of data. This blog will document some of the components of the course that I find the most interesting as well as any challenges I may face. If you are interested in learning more, feel free to sign up for the next cohort or walk through the videos at your own pace. My code and notes will be available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wilson2214/zoomcamp).
